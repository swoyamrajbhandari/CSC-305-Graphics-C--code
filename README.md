Computer graphics: Image synthesis using ray tracing and rasterization (C++/CMake)
- Created images using ray tracing with parallel and perspective projections. 
- Implemented shadings such as shadows, reflection and Perlin noise to enrich images.
- Implemented ray tracing for a triangle mesh with an accelerating structure algorithm.
- Implemented a rendering system for triangulated 3D models based on rasterization.
